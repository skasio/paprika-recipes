            <p class="line">
              You will also need a very large, deep pan with a lid.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Simmer the barley in a pan of salted water until it is tender -- a
              matter of twenty minutes or so but taste it to check it -- then
              drain it.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Lightly brown the jointed chicken in the fat in a large, deep
              ovenproof pan. I do this in a relay, three or four pieces at a
              time, over a moderately high heat. Transfer the browned chicken to
              a plate. While the chicken is browning you need to cut the carrot
              and parsnip into large chunks and the leek, thoroughly scrubbed
              and freed of grit (it gets between the layers) into short lengths.
              I think it is important to keep the vegetables in fat juicy chunks
              for this. Cut the onion in half and then into large segments. Once
              the chicken is out of the pan, add the vegetables, turn them in
              the fat and let them soften a little, though don&apos;t let them
              colour. In another pan bring enough water to boil to cover the
              bird. Set the oven at 180°C /Gas 4.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Keeping the vegetables in their pan, drain every little bit of oil
              from the pan, otherwise you will only have to do it later. Now
              return the chicken to the pan with the pearl barley, then tuck in
              all the herbs except the parsley and pour over the hot water.
              Season with salt and some black pepper. Now slice the potatoes the
              thickness of pound coins -- I really think there is no need to
              peel them -- and lay them over the top of the chicken and
              vegetables. Some will inevitably sink; others will sit on top, the
              water just lapping at their edges.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Cover with a lid and place in the oven for an hour and a half, by
              which time the chicken and vegetables will be meltingly tender.
              Remove the lid, turn up pthe heat to 200°C/Gas 6 and leave for
              thirty minutes for the potatoes to colour here and there. Remove
              very carefully from the oven -- the pan will be full and very hot
              -- then scrape off any floating oil from the top. Chop the parsley
              and sink it into the broth. Taste the broth and adjust the
              seasoning with a grinding of salt and pepper.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Spoon the chicken, vegetables, barley and plenty of the broth into
              shallow bowls, scatter with flakes of sea salt and pass round the
              the pepper mill.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              As mentioned above the past way to serve this piping hot meal is
              directly from the steaming pot. Place it on the table and let your
              guests help themselves. A good wintery green salad like kale
              served with pomegranates would be a perfect accompaniment. The end
              result is something between a soup and a stew. The chicken is
              moist and melts in your mouth while the soft vegetables are
              velvety smooth having absorbed all the flavour of the chicken and
              herbs.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              And for dessert nothing beats a Pecan Pie. You can pop it in the
              oven right after the chicken comes out.
