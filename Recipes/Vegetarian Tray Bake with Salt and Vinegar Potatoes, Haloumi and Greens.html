            <p class="line">
              1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C and select two baking trays (ideally
              40cm x 30cm).
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              2. Scrub the potatoes then dry with a tea towel. Cut the potatoes
              in half lengthways, then into 1.5cm wide half-moons.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              3. Divide the potatoes across the two trays. Drizzle four
              tablespoons of olive oil over the potatoes (2 tablespoons per
              tray) with a generous pinch of flaky sea salt, then use your hands
              to massage the oil and salt into them. Ideally, the biggest
              surface area of each potato is in contact with the baking tray.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              4. Place the trays in the oven and roast for about 15 minutes
              until the potatoes are just beginning to turn golden.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              5. While you wait, prep the other ingredients: slice each slab of
              haloumi in half so you have a total of four rectangular pieces, if
              using two blocks of haloumi. This is to ensure the cheese cooks
              nicely without drying out (you&apos;ll be tearing it into chunks
              later). Finely dice the shallots; and finely chop the mint (making
              sure the chopping board is dry when you do so, so the mint stays
              fresh).
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              6. After 15 minutes, remove the trays and toss the potatoes. Make
              space for the haloumi in the middle of the trays, then place two
              slabs on each. Crack some pepper over the haloumi and drizzle with
              oil, then return the trays to the oven and roast for 10-15 more
              minutes until the potatoes are golden brown and the haloumi is
              warmed through with golden edges. Keep in mind that each brand of
              haloumi will cook a little differently.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              7. Remove the haloumi onto a chopping board and set aside. Drizzle
              3 tablespoons vinegar over the potatoes (1.5 tablespoons per
              tray). Give it a moment to allow the potatoes to soak up the
              vinegar, then divide the rocket and shallots between the trays.
              Give everything a toss to distribute the vinegar and allow the
              rocket to wilt. Taste a potato and add more vinegar as desired.
              The vinegar should shout at you, albeit pleasantly.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              8. Tear the haloumi into bite-sized chunks and add them to a
              mixing bowl. Top with lemon zest and juice, then give everything a
              stir.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              9. Serve the potatoes, rocket and shallots in bowls and top with
              haloumi chunks, along with any juice in the bottom of the bowl.
              Scatter mint and serve.
