            <p class="line">
              Add the flour and salt into a large bowl, mix together.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              In a small saucepan, warm the water with butter until they are
              very hot, but not boiling (temperature should be around 80-90 °C /
              176-194 °F, that is when the water starts to move and steam).
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Pour hot water with butter into the bowl with flour, mix with a
              wooden spoon until roughly combined.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Knead the dough using your hands or with a stand mixer fitted with
              a hook attachment, for about 5 minutes. A food processor can also
              be used (fitted with the dough blade). The dough should be smooth,
              soft and elastic, it shouldn’t stick to your hands. When you
              follow the recipe (especially if you weight the ingredients,
              instead of using measuring cups), the dough should be perfect, but
              if for some reason it’s not, add some water if it’s too dry, or a
              little bit flour if it’s too wet. If the dough already forms a
              ball, is relatively smooth, but still tough, it means that it’s
              not ready, it must be further kneaded until soft and elastic
              (after resting time it will be even softer).
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Wrap the kneaded dough in plastic foil (so it doesn’t dry out),
              leave to rest for about 30 minutes (it will be easy to roll out).

            <p class="line">
              Onto a lightly floured surface, roll out thinly the first piece of
              the dough, to a thickness of approx. 2 mm / 1/16 inch. If the
              dough is hard to roll out, set it aside for about 5-10 minutes to
              rest.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Use a cup or a pierogi/pastry cutter to cut out rounds. Place one
              ball of filling / 1 teaspoon of filling on each round.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Gather scraps, cover with plastic wrap and set aside.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Press
              edges together, sealing and crimping with your fingers. Do not
              leave any gaps or pierogi may open during cooking.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Place the pierogi apart on a towel lightly sprinkled with flour
              (this is important, they can stick to the board), cover loosely
              with a kitchen cloth so that they don‘t dry out.

            <p class="line">
              Cook the pierogi in batches (for a 21 cm /8-inch pot I cook about
              10-12 dumplings at a time). When they float to the water surface
              cook them for 1-2 minutes, then remove from the water with a
              slotted spoon. The cooking time will depend on the thickness of
              the dough.

              Drain well and transfer onto a plate. Serve warm, pour over some

        <!-- Notes -->

        <div class="notesbox">
          <h3 class="subhead">Notes</h3>
          <div itemprop="comment" class="notes text">
            <p>
              Cooking time: will depend on the thickness of the dough. Cut one
              pieróg in half to see if the dough is cooked through. Cook the
              pierogi to your desired consistency. Some like them chewier and
              some very tender.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dough to filling ratio: it’s very important but it’s also a matter
              of taste. I like my pierogi dough not too thin but also not very
              thick. Experiment what works best for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              What to do with leftover dough: Cut it into thick strips and use
              it as pasta eg with soup. You can also fill the leftover dough
              with fruit with sugar.
            </p>
            <p>
              How to store pierogi:To ensure that the cooked pierogi don‘t stick
              to each other, brush them lightly with melted butter or oil. Store
              in a tightly-closed container in the fridge for about 2 days. On
              the next day, it‘s best to pan-fry them with butter until
              golden.Freshly cooked pierogi taste best, so I usually do this: I
              prepare only the amount of pierogi that we are going to eat on a
              given day (about 14 per person). I wrap the rest of the dough
              tightly in plastic foil and put it in the fridge. I place the rest
              of the filling (or make filling balls from all of the filling) and
              also tightly wrap in plastic foil and put in the fridge. On the
              next day (or even on the third day) I’m preparing the rest of the
              pierogi. If I have more time and I’m making more pierogi in one
              batch, I freeze them or pan-fry then with butter the next
              day.After removing the dough from the fridge, it is good to
              slightly warm it up (leave it for about 15-30 minutes on the
              counter), it will be more elastic (this is optional). The next day
              the dough will be a little gray in color, but we don‘t mind that.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to freeze pierogi:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Cooked pierogi: Place the pierogi apart on a tray that is
              sprinkled well with flour. Freeze until solid. Transfer to
              containers on plastic bags. Cook like fresh pierogi but take them
              out once they float to the water surface.
            </p>
            <p>
              Uncooked pierogi: Note that not boiled raw pierogi are more likely
              to crack in a freezer than cooked pierogi. I most often freeze raw
              pierogi though. Place the pierogi on a tray / wooden board
              sprinkled well with flour (important, dumplings can easily stick
              to the tray and tear). Arrange the dumplings so that they do not
              touch each other. When frozen, transfer them into containers or
              plastic bags. I cook frozen dumplings just like fresh ones, with
              the difference that you can cook a smaller amount of them at a
              time, I cook max. 7-8 frozen pierogi at once (and about 10-12
              fresh). When you drop too many frozen pierogi at once it will
              lower the temperature of the water too much and they will burst.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rolling out with pasta machine: I have a Kitchen Aid pasta roller
              attachment. I roll out the dough on setting 4. According to the
              manufacturer’s instructions you need to roll out the dough on each
              setting until you get to the setting 4. I’m not doing this,
              pierogi dough without an egg is easier to roll out than an egg
              dough or pasta dough. To make it possible, the dough must be well
              sprinkled with flour, at room temperature, slightly rolled out
              with a rolling pin (to a thickness of approx. ¾ cm / ½ inch). and
              smooth (otherwise will tear).
