            <p class="line">
              Start by making the jam. Slice rhubarb and strawberries thinly and
              add them to a sauce pan together with the rest of the jam
              ingredients. Cook on low heat for approx. 20 minutes until soft.
              Use a hand blender to mix it if you prefer it smooth, or leave it
              chunky. Let cool entirely. Meanwhile, prepare the raw hazelnut
              wafer.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Add hazelnuts, rolled oats, cacao powder and salt to a food
              processor and mix thoroughly until the texture resembles sand.
              Pour into a separate bowl. Add dates and coconut oil to the food
              processor and mix into a paste. Pour the mixed nuts back and pulse
              everything until it’s combined into a dough. Roll it into a log
              and divide into two equal halves. Use a pen to copy the exact size
              of the baking dish onto a baking paper, then roll out one of the
              wafer dough halves on the baking sheet until it has the right
              shape, use a second baking sheet on top to prevent the rolling pin
              from sticking. Transfer the baking paper with the wafer to the
              baking dish and place in the freezer while preparing the ice cream
              (or vegan version further down).
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Combine quark cheese, mascarpone and 2-3 tbsp maple syrup
              (depending on how sweet you prefer it) in a mixing bowl. Add 1/2
              cup / 125 ml of the cooled rhubarb &amp; strawberry jam. Stir
              until combined. Take out the baking dish from the freezer and pour
              the ice cream mixture on top. Spoon more jam on top (roughly 1/2
              cup / 100-150 ml) and use a spoon to swirl it evenly. Put back in
              the freezer for 1-2 hours to firm up.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Roll out the second half of the wafer dough using the same method
              as the first. Use a fork to make hole patterns and then turn it
              upside-down on to a second baking sheet. Remove the ice cream from
              the freezer and carefully transfer the wafer on top of the ice
              cream. Put it back in the freezer for 3-4 hours until completely
              firm. Then take it out, cut into 10 rectangles or 20 squares using
              a sharp knife dipped in hot water, wrap with baking paper and
              store in the freezer.

              Drain the soaked cashew nuts and add them to a high-speed blender
              together with coconut milk, maple syrup and lemon juice. Mix on
              high speed until smooth. Add 1/2 cup / 100-150 ml of the cooled
              rhubarb &amp; strawberry jam and pulse until combined. Take out
              the baking dish from the freezer and pour the ice cream mixture on
              top. Spoon more jam on top (roughly 1/2 cup / 100-150 ml) and use
              a spoon to swirl it evenly. Put back in the freezer for 1-2 hours
              to firm up. Follow the remaining instructions in the main recipe.

              Here’s another rhubarb treat I did the other day. I didn’t follow
              an exact recipe but I kind of based it on this recipe from our
              archive and replaced the grated apple with lots of rhubarb jam and
              the apple slices on top with rhubarb and strawberry bits. Skip the
              cinnamon on top and just add a little cardamom to the batter, in
              case you feel like trying it.
