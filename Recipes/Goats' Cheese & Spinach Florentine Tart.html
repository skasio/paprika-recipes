            <p class="line">
              Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full
              kettle
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Add the chopped potatoes to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a
              drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25
              min or until the potatoes are starting to brown
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              While the potatoes are in the oven, add the spinach to a colander
              and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it&apos;s
              cool
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can,
              then chop roughly
            </p>
            <p class="line">Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p>
            <p class="line">
              Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle
              of olive oil over a medium-high heat
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Once hot add the chopped wilted spinach and chopped garlic with a
              generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until
              the garlic has softened
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Stir through half the goats&apos; cheese (you&apos;ll use the rest
              later!) with a splash of water and cook for 1 min further – this
              is your creamy spinach
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Meanwhile, line a separate baking tray (or two!) with non-stick
              baking paper
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness
              with a rolling pin and cut into 2 [4]
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Add the pastry to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the
              edge of the pastry with a knife
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Top the pastry with the creamy spinach (keep it within the
              borders!)
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Break up the remaining goats’ cheese and sprinkle it over the top
              equally (leave the centre empty as this is where your egg will
              go!)
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 9 min or until the
              pastry edges have begun to puff up
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Meanwhile, combine the green tomato chutney, white wine vinegar
              and 2 tbsp [4 tbsp] olive oil in a small bowl – this is your
              chutney dressing
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Once the tarts have had an initial 9 min, remove the tray[s] from
              the oven and crack the eggs into the centre
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Return the tarts to the oven for a final 6 min or until the eggs
              are cooked (the yolk should still be a little runny) and the
              pastry is golden and cooked through – these are your goats&apos;
              cheese &amp; spinach florentine tarts
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Wash the rocket, then pat it dry withkitchen paper
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Serve the goats&apos; cheese &amp; spinach florentine tarts with
              the roast potatoes and rocket mixed together to the side
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Drizzle over the chutney dressing and finish with a grind of black
              pepper
            </p>
            <p class="line">Enjoy!</p>
